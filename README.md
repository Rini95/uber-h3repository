# 🚀 Traffic Prediction, Disaster Response & Environmental Monitoring using Uber H3

This project leverages **Uber's H3** spatial indexing system to analyze geospatial data for traffic prediction, disaster response, and environmental monitoring around Sydney. By converting geographical coordinates into hexagonal grids, the project enables efficient spatial analysis across various domains, including transportation, emergency response, and environmental management.

## 🔍 Key Features

### ✅ **Traffic Prediction**
- Converts raw GPS data into hexagonal grids for efficient spatial analysis.
- Identifies traffic congestion hotspots and optimizes route planning.
- Predicts traffic flow based on historical movement patterns.

### ✅ **Disaster Response**
- Maps disaster-prone areas using hexagonal binning.
- Assists responders in resource allocation for floods, bushfires, and other emergencies.
- Provides structured geospatial insights to support crisis management efforts.

### ✅ **Environmental Monitoring**
- Tracks air quality, pollution levels, and climate data in hexagonal grids.
- Integrates remote sensing data to support sustainable urban planning.
- Helps decision-makers manage eco-friendly initiatives in city development.

## 🔗 Technologies Used
